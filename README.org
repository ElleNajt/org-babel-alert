Emacs package to send customizable alerts when org babel cells finish.

* Customization
When a cell finishes, it sends customizable string to a user specified program. The string can contain the buffer name, the file, the line number, and the results of the cell.

By default this is configured to use notify-send, but using an external programs you can send yourself a discord or slack message, a phone call, a postcard, etc.

This is customized with `org-babel-alerts/notification-command.`

Using `org-babel-alerts/long-running-threshold`, customize the amount of time that a cell runs for to automatically trigger a notification.

Use the header argument `:alert yes` to get a notification when a cell finishes.
